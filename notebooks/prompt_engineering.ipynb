       "AIMessage(content=\"The meaning of life is a profound question that has been contemplated by philosophers, theologians, and individuals throughout history. There is no one definitive answer that is universally accepted, as the meaning of life can vary depending on personal beliefs, experiences, and perspectives. However, some common themes that emerge in discussions about the meaning of life include:\\n\\n* **Purpose and Fulfillment:** Many people find meaning in life by pursuing goals, passions, or activities that give them a sense of purpose and fulfillment. This could involve contributing to society, making a difference in the world, or simply living a life that is true to one's values and aspirations.\\n\\n* **Relationships and Connections:** Strong relationships with family, friends, and loved ones can provide a deep sense of meaning and belonging. Nurturing these relationships and investing in the well-being of others can bring joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose.\\n\\n* **Personal Growth and Development:** Embracing personal growth and development can give life meaning. This involves learning new skills, expanding knowledge, and challenging oneself to become a better person. By continuously growing and evolving, individuals can find a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment.\\n\\n* **Contribution to the World:** Making a positive contribution to the world, no matter how small, can give life meaning. This could involve volunteering, helping others, or simply living a life that is guided by compassion and kindness. By leaving a positive impact on the world, individuals can feel a sense of purpose and fulfillment.\\n\\n* **Experiencing Joy and Beauty:** Life can be filled with moments of joy, beauty, and wonder. Appreciating these moments and savoring the experiences that bring happiness can give life meaning. By cultivating gratitude and mindfulness, individuals can find joy in the present moment and appreciate the beauty of the world around them.\\n\\nUltimately, the meaning of life is a personal journey that each individual must discover for themselves. It is a question that can be revisited and re-evaluated throughout life as experiences, perspectives, and priorities change. By reflecting on what brings fulfillment, purpose, and joy, individuals can find their own unique meaning in life.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': [{'category': 'HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT', 'probability': 'NEGLIGIBLE', 'blocked': False}, {'category': 'HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH', 'probability': 'NEGLIGIBLE', 'blocked': False}, {'category': 'HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT', 'probability': 'NEGLIGIBLE', 'blocked': False}, {'category': 'HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT', 'probability': 'NEGLIGIBLE', 'blocked': False}]}, id='run-38515e54-5575-49b0-8c9f-39345f85cef9-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 8, 'output_tokens': 428, 'total_tokens': 436, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})"
